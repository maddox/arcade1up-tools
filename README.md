## Advanced RetroPie/Raspberry Pi Customizations

Here's some tricks of the trade to make your Arcade1Up mod look more official.

### Hide console output on boot

Edit `/boot/cmdline.text` and set `console=tty3`

### Hide Raspbery Pi Logo on boot

Edit `/boot/cmdline.text` and add `logo.nologo`

### Hide EmulationStation Splash screen

This disables EmulationStation's splash screen so that your custom splash screen shows until everything is completely booted up.

Edit `/opt/retropie/configs/all/autostart.sh` to be

    emulationstation --no-splash #auto
